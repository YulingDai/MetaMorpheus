The data analysis was performed using MetaMorpheus version Not a release version. DEBUG., available at https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus.
The following search settings were used: protease = trypsin; maximum missed cleavages = 2; minimum peptide length = 7; maximum peptide length = unspecified; initiator methionine behavior = Variable; fixed modifications = Carbamidomethyl on C, Carbamidomethyl on U; variable modifications = Oxidation on M; max mods per peptide = 2; max modification isoforms = 1024; precursor mass tolerance = ±5.0000 PPM; product mass tolerance = ±20.0000 PPM; report PSM ambiguity = True. The combined search database contained 17053 non-decoy protein entries including 0 contaminant sequences.
